# MintNFT

# Tech Stack:

Frontend: ReactJS
Backend: Node.js (Express or any other framework)
Blockchain: Ethereum (using the ERC-721 standard)

# Step 1: Set Up the Smart Contracts:

Develop the ERC-721 smart contract to represent the NFT. This contract should include functions to mint new NFTs, set royalty fees, and transfer the royalties to the treasury and liquidity wallets.
Deploy the smart contract to your chosen Ethereum network (mainnet, testnet, or a custom network).

# Step 2: Create the Backend:

Set up a backend server using Node.js to handle API requests from the frontend and interact with the blockchain.
Use a web3 library (like web3.js) to connect to the Ethereum network and interact with the deployed smart contract.
Step 3: Frontend Development:

Create a welcome page with a "Connect to Wallet" button that allows users to connect their Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the web app.
Once the user is connected, display the wallet address on the frontend.

# Step 4: NFT Minter Page:

Design the NFT minter page with sections for general info, meta-data, and price input.
Allow users to enter the NFT name, choose the NFT file to upload (this should be stored off-chain on IPFS, cloud storage, etc.), and set the price for the NFT.

# Step 5: Minting NFTs:

When the user submits the NFT minting form, trigger a transaction to mint the NFT using the smart contract.
Include the logic in the smart contract to handle royalty fees and transfer the appropriate percentage to the treasury and liquidity wallets.

# Step 6: Tokenomics and Wallets:

Set up two wallets on the blockchain: liquidity wallet and treasury wallet.
When a user mints an NFT and sets a price, apply a 10% royalty fee to the price.
Transfer 6% of the royalty fee to the treasury wallet and 4% to the liquidity wallet.
